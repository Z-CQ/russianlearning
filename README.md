A CLI program I wrote in Python to test your linguistic knowledge. Was originally written for Russian, but should work normally with other languages like Spanish, Polish, German, etc.
I plan to implement more modes (spelling, grammar) and perhaps A.I. integration to add new words as you go or prioritize words you struggle with.

Only works on Linux, and there are no current plans for Windows.
